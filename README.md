# Bioinformatics Hub

## Goal

This repository will aim to reformat our existing workflows into a more easily accessible format.

The goal is to reorganise guides with broader utilisation that were originally written for a single workflow.

Once things are up and running, it should be easier for everyone else (who is not me :joy:) to find the information they need.
