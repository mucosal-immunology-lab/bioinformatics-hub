# LCMS analysis

Here we will provide a guide for the processing of raw LCMS output files from metabolomics and lipidomics runs, how to undertake curation and annotation, and approaches for their analysis downstream.

## Overview

The MS-DIAL software we recommend provides a pipeline for untargeted metabolomics. Its outputs then require thorough quality control measures and additional annotation steps. Additional annotation with HMDB and/or LIPID MAPS supplements the annotations provided through standards and MS-DIAL to ensure we can retain and utilise the maximum number of features.
